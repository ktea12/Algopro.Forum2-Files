The Expansion of Rome and the Equestrian Order

Used as we are to the terminology and conditions of hereditary monarchy
and territorial sovereignty, we find it hard to appreciate, or even
to express in terms of modern politics the difficulties which beset
the statesmen of Rome at the death of Augustus; and we are further
tempted to read into the story of that critical period ideas, which
were only conceivable after the crisis was over; we can hardly avoid
seeing those days in the light of subsequent events, or speaking
of them in language which involves anachronism. Our information is
principally derived from historians, who wrote a century and a half
after the death of Julius Caesar, when the Government of the Emperor
and the Senate was established; but the position of the Emperor of
those days was not the position of Augustus, and the Senate of Trajan
was not the Senate of Tiberius. The experienced officials who formed
the majority of the Senate of the Flavian Emperors were no longer the
hereditary oligarchy by whose capacity Rome had been brought to be
first among the city states of the world, but which was unequal to the
task of organizing the Roman empire. The change had, however, escaped
observation, and the warmest admirers of the Senate of the Republic
were men whose position had been won for them by the Emperors. Between
the death of Augustus and the death of Vespasian we have but few
contemporary historians; we have no letters of Cicero to throw light
on the inner life of the statesmen of those days; there were private
records, private letters, and private biographies; we can gather their
tone from the extracts that have been preserved for us, but we have no
opportunity of comparing them or checking them. Velleius Paterculus is
the only contemporary historian of the reign of Tiberius, a portion of
whose work still exists unabridged; and his narrative stops just at the
period when we require most light at the conspiracy of Sejanus where
there is also a gap in the annals of Tacitus. From the books of the
New Testament we may infer much as to how the Empire appeared at a
comparatively early period to the inhabitants of Greater Rome, much
also from Josephus, a little from Philo, but we cannot people the
Rome of Tiberius, as we can people the Rome of Augustus and the Rome
of Cicero. Two facts stand clear to us from the pages of Tacitus, and
in a less degree from those of Suetonius, that the Imperial Family was
divided, that the old Roman princely houses never forgave the Empire,
and that there was a Republican reaction in opinion at the centre of
the Empire. History has repeated itself; just as the Curia of today
cannot forgive the monarchy which represents the unity of Italy, so
the Curia of the first century of the Christian era was irreconcilable
to the monarchical constitution which represented the unity of the
Empire. The Roman princes who wrote the memoirs of their houses for
the edification of their children, and the delectation of their
friends never inquired into the authority of a story derogatory to
the Emperors, and the one Emperor, who was never spared was Tiberius;
it is no exaggeration to say that the madness of Caligula, and the
monstrous freaks of Nero are dealt with tenderly by the writers of the
silver age, if we compare the accounts of these with the deliberate
malignity which attends on every word and action of Tiberius; and yet
common sense tells us that only a very able man could have succeeded
Augustus without breaking up his work. At the death of Augustus it was
still possible that there would be no second Emperor; at the death of
Tiberius the Roman Emperor had become an institution, the pivot upon
which the whole machinery of civilized existence turned throughout
the world. Hence the peculiar bitterness against Tiberius; the Curia
felt that in his reign their last chance had gone, and more than this,
that he had been in some sense a traitor to his own caste. Neither the
Julian nor the Octavian families had been among the foremost houses
of Rome, till the genius of the first Caesar raised them from their
comparative obscurity; but many of the most important events in the
history of Rome, no less than her buildings, her roads, her aqueducts,
and many of her public monuments, were associated with the Claudian
stock, and the Livian, with which it was inter married, was only less
distinguished. Augustus had been tolerated, for his services to the
State could not be disregarded, but some day Augustus would die; he did
die; his power fell into the hands of the most prominent representative
of the old Roman nobility; the opportunity for a restoration of the
narrow oligarchy of the Republic came, and it passed away for ever. Two
years after the death of Tiberius his lunatic successor was stabbed by
a soldier whom he had insulted; the State was left a few days without a
head, and the Curia was so inanimate that it could neither restore its
own rule, nor provide a new Emperor; it had to accept apparently at the
dictation of the soldiers in the Praetorian barracks a man of letters
who had hitherto been the laughing stock of the Imperial family.
